### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mariam Elzoghby!

I'm pursuing a Master of Science in Applied Quantitative Economic Analysis and Policy at Pace University.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a study investigating the effect of graduation year on earnings and primary job promotion
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning how to code using Python in my data analytics course 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can speak Arabic, specifically the Egyptian dialect! I've also visited the Pyramids of Giza and I have a cat named Simba!
